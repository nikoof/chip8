A cross-platform CHIP-8 interpreter. The interpreter's behaviour is controlled via command-line arguments, and the display is implemented as a GUI. This setup is obviously not ideal, and it will probably change in the future to include a fully-featured GUI for both configuration and rendering.

The interpreter fully implements the original COSMAC VIP CHIP-8 instruction set.
I am currently planning to also add support for SUPER-CHIP (and maybe XO-CHIP).

# Usage
```
$ octarou --help
Usage: octarou [OPTIONS] <PROGRAM>

Arguments:
  <PROGRAM>  Path to a file containing a CHIP-8 program

Options:
  -v, --variant <VARIANT>              CHIP-8 variant to interpret [default: chip8] [possible values: chip8, schip]
  -W, --window-width <WINDOW_WIDTH>    Window width [default: 640]
  -H, --window-height <WINDOW_HEIGHT>  Window height [default: 320]
  -s, --cpu-speed <CPU_SPEED>          Speed of CPU (in CH8-ops/second) [default: 700]
  -h, --help                           Print help
  -V, --version                        Print version
```

The `-v`/`--variant` argument is used to select which CHIP-8 variant should be interpreted. It is currently impossible to selectively toggle specific quirks, though this may be added in the future.

# Building with Nix
The project can be built using Nix flakes.

## Linux and \*NIXes
```shell
$ # build
$ nix build github:nikoof/octarou
$ ./result/bin/octarou --help
$ # ...or run it directly
$ nix run github:nikoof/octarou -- --help
```

## Windows
Building for Windows is done via cross-compilation with Nix on a Linux host.
```shell
$ nix build github:Nikoof/octarou#windowsCross
```
The resulting binary is at `result/bin/octarou.exe`.

# Building manually
Alternatively, you can clone the repo and compile the project natively on all major platforms.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nikoof/octarou && cd octarou
$ cargo run --release -- --help
```
