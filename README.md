A cross-platform CHIP-8 interpreter. The interpreter's behaviour is controlled via command-line arguments, and the display is implemented as a GUI. This setup is obviously not ideal, and it will probably change in the future to include a fully-featured GUI for both configuration and rendering.

The interpreter fully implements:
- the original COSMAC VIP CHIP-8 instruction set.
- the [SUPER-CHIP 1.1](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/schip.txt) extension

I might implement support for other variants (for example, XO-CHIP).

One of my main goals with this project is for it to be as "correct" as possible, so should you discover any issues with this implementation, please feel free to open an issue. 

# Usage
```
$ octarou --help
Usage: octarou [OPTIONS] <PROGRAM>

Arguments:
  <PROGRAM>  Path to a file containing a CHIP-8 program

Options:
  -v, --variant <VARIANT>              CHIP-8 variant to interpret [default: chip8] [possible values: chip8, schip]
  -W, --window-width <WINDOW_WIDTH>    Window width [default: 640]
  -H, --window-height <WINDOW_HEIGHT>  Window height [default: 320]
  -s, --cpu-speed <CPU_SPEED>          Speed of CPU (in CH8-ops/second) [default: 700]
  -h, --help                           Print help
  -V, --version                        Print version
```

The `-v`/`--variant` argument is used to select which CHIP-8 variant should be interpreted. It is currently impossible to selectively toggle specific quirks, though this may be added in the future.

# Building with Nix
The project can be built using Nix flakes.

## Linux and \*NIXes
```shell
$ # build
$ nix build github:nikoof/octarou
$ ./result/bin/octarou --help
$ # ...or run it directly
$ nix run github:nikoof/octarou -- --help
```

## Windows
Building for Windows is done via cross-compilation with Nix on a Linux host.
```shell
$ nix build github:Nikoof/octarou#windowsCross
```
The resulting binary is at `result/bin/octarou.exe`.

# Building manually
Alternatively, you can clone the repo and compile the project natively on all major platforms.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nikoof/octarou && cd octarou
$ cargo run --release -- --help
```
